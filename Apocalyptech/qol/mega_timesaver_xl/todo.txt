Upright coffinish chests in Sunfang Oasis have a pretty long delay before
activating loot beams, when opening.  There's one just to the left when you
go out of the initial level bit, and are about to jump down the waterfall.

Pearl chests in Raiders of the Lost Shark

Tooth Fairy chest in Weepwild Dankness goes crazy when closed; wonder if
that's a specific one we can tweak back down to usual, or not.
